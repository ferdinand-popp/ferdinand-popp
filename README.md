ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ferdinand-popp
Currently Iâ€™m a Master of Science Student Molecular Biology at the University of Heidelberg and the German Cancer Research Center.
In this Repo I forked interesting projects to learn and combine them.

Projects I did are currently private, until they are published or if they contain sensible patient data. Some of my projects are private due to company affiliation, sorry!
